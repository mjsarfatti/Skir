# Skir

*Skir* is the easy way to simple PHP apps. And by easy I mean that:

1. it gets out of the way (jQuery style);
2. it is lightweight (as in “way less then 50 KB in no more then 5 files” lightweight).

It implements a front controller pattern (aka MVC) with autoloading capabilities coupled with a toolkit (thank you
[Bastian Allgeier](http://getkirby.com/home) for the inspiration!) that takes care of all those tasks most developers have
to deal with. Yes, *most*: it doesn’t try to solve every possible problem and situation, since there is already plenty of
big and important PHP frameworks for that.

## Version

*Skir* is totally **alpha** at the moment. Well, the MVC pattern and the database class are fully functional, but the
toolkit is still in its early stages and most classes I intend to provide have yet to be written.
